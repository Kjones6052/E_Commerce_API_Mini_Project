Overview:

This portion of the project focuses on React functional components to create a user interface that accesses and works with the SQL 
Database to send and recieve data for an e commerce application. All the files I created will be located in the src folder, which includes 
a main.jsx and app.jsx which run the main app code. Also included in the src folder is a components folder, which includes 3 additional 
folders for customers, orders, and products, as well as jsx files for the home page, navigation bar, and not found page. Each of the 3 
additional folders contain code files for pages related to the title of each folder(e.g. customers has files specific to customer 
components).
